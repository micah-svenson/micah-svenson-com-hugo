As hard as we try to stare bleary eye'd at numerous metrics, introspect previous sprints, change processes to improve effciency and productivity... As soon as the November/December holiday season rolls around, people start taking vacation, and ... the team gets MORE done?

Did we get more done? Our velocity metrics say so. How can that be true?

Planning the goals and content of a sprint have huge implications on how a sprint flows as well as how much gets done.
