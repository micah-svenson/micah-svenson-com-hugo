Idea, whenenver I get into a topic, write a post about why this topic/thing/etc is the best thing and everyone should use it. Then write a section on why Something that opposes that thing is the best thing ever. Then write a section on a balanced approach for each. The idea is tha this format allows the mind to run wild with all the possibilities of what this thing can accomplish, then what things are terrible about it, then use both extremes to come to a balanced perspective.
