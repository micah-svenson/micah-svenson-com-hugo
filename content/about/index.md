I am a Software Engineer with an Aerospace Engineering background. I currently act as senior engineer and engineering manager for a small team developing modeling and simulation software and analysis products in the space control domain. 

When I'm not at work, you can find me learning new programming languages, discovering new technology, or most likely riding my Mountain Bike. 

When I find something interesting in tech, I blog about it! Topics include software engineering, space, teams, and more.

The joy of mountain biking is worth sharing. I write about my experiences as an amateur mountain biker racer, fun adventures I have had, and who know what else!

Sometimes, I learn new things today. Ill will spend a few minutes diving into random things I learn and you get to benefit! Useful or useless? You decide.
