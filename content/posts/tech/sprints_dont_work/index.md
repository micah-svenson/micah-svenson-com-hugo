If Sprints Don't work, why does everyone use them, smart ass?

**Hot Take: Sprints are just mini water falls.**

You heard that right. If we can all agree that the core of Agile's success is constant adaptability, why did we throw that away with sprints in scrum? Software changes fast. Requirements change fast. Bugs come up FAST. So how do we handle these? "Ah, we'll just have to fix it in two weeks." 

## Don't let Scrum Hold Your Team Back
In scrum there are tradeoffs to consider. If you increase your cycle time, your adaptability and reactivity suffers. If you reduce your cycle time you increase your overhead with sprint planning, retrospectives, etc causing efficiency to suffer and stress to go sky high. 

If you can't find a balance between overhead and cycle time and are waiting to accomplish tasks until the next sprint when you know full well it would be best to get started with them asap, mabye its time to re=evaluate the framework.

## Customer Feedback is Key
What enables fast cycle times? Customer feedback and clarity on the near term roadmap.


## A Better Approach for Small Teams
Continuous Flow. That's right, Kanban. Infinte flexibility, metrics to ensure work is progressing smoothly and adding value, and a simple roadmap to plan future features.
